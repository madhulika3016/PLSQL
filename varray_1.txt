The PL/SQL programming language provides a data structure called the VARRAY, which can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. A varray is used to store an ordered collection of data, however it is often better to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

All varrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.

Creating a Varray Type
A varray type is created with the CREATE TYPE statement. You must specify the maximum size and the type of elements stored in the varray.

The basic syntax for creating a VARRAY type at the schema level is -

CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE varray_type_name IS VARRAY(n) of <element_type>

Where,

varray_type_name is a valid attribute name,
n is the number of elements (maximum) in the varray,
element_type is the data type of the elements of the array.
Maximum size of a varray can be changed using the ALTER TYPE statement.

For example,

CREATE Or REPLACE TYPE namearray AS VARRAY(3) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
/ 

Type created.
The basic syntax for creating a VARRAY type within a PL/SQL block is -

TYPE varray_type_name IS VARRAY(n) of <element_type>
For example -

TYPE namearray IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
Type grades IS VARRAY(5) OF INTEGER;

DECLARE 
   type namesarray IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(10); 
   type grades IS VARRAY(5) OF INTEGER; 
   names namesarray; 
   marks grades; 
   total integer; 
BEGIN 
   names := namesarray('Kavita', 'Pritam', 'Ayan', 'Rishav', 'Aziz'); 
   marks:= grades(98, 97, 78, 87, 92); 
   total := names.count; 
   dbms_output.put_line('Total '|| total || ' Students'); 
   FOR i in 1 .. total LOOP 
      dbms_output.put_line('Student: ' || names(i) || ' 
      Marks: ' || marks(i)); 
   END LOOP; 

END;
